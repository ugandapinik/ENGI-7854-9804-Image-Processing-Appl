Image processing techniques use filters to enhance an image. Their main applications are to transform the contrast, brightness, resolution and noise level of an image. Contouring, image sharpening,



## Final Project
Instagram is one of the famous and fast-growing photos and videos sharing social media platform. There
are plenty of ways to search for pictures on Instagram, but one of the most common methods of using is
'hashtag.' There are no rules for hashtag; that is why most of the time, the hashtag does not match with
the uploaded image.

## Labs
### Lab 1 [(click here)](https://github.com/wohhie/ENGI-7854-9804-Image-Processing-Appl/tree/master/Labs/Lab1)
The objective of this laboratory is to become familiar with geometric transformations and
histogram equalization.

### Lab 2 [(click here)](https://github.com/wohhie/ENGI-7854-9804-Image-Processing-Appl/tree/master/Labs/Lab2)
The objective of this laboratory exercise to compare the smoothing effects on different kernel. 


### Lab 3 [(click here)](https://github.com/wohhie/ENGI-7854-9804-Image-Processing-Appl/tree/master/Labs/Lab3)
The objective of this laboratory exercise is to get familiarized with frequency domain filtering
concepts

### Lab 4 [(click here)](https://github.com/wohhie/ENGI-7854-9804-Image-Processing-Appl/tree/master/Labs/Lab4)
The objective of this exercise is to understand and calculate some of features used as image
descriptors. Huâ€™s seven moment invariants are insensitive to changes in scale, position and
rotation. These moment invariants have been extensively applied to image pattern recognition,
image registration, and image reconstruction.
